		<p>Users will be able to find the most acustic polluted places in Madrid.</p>
		<p>This information will be shown via SPARQL queries. The levels of pollution are measured as the average
			of the pollution during a day, or a specific period of a day. The measurements are monthly, so the user
			will be able to see a clear picture of the area's pollution.</p>
		<p>The interface, if there is one, will be minimal or even via console.</p>
