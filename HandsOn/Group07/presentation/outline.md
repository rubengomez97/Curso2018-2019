# Outline of our presentation
## data gathered
- dataset (subjects, origin, license)
## openRefine
- clean it and transform it into a datacube
## linked data structure
- include the picture on this directory (Luciano explains what the structure means)
## pre-extraction of the average for each month (since it's a proof of concept, making the computer do a lot of averages doesn't make too much sense)
- mention the application we made in Java with Jena to extract the means, since the data was far too big
